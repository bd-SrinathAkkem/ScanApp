Start with a decision node: "Airgap Mode Enabled?". From here, the flow splits into two paths: "No" (Non-Airgap) and "Yes" (Airgap).

**Path 1: Airgap Mode Enabled? = No (Non-Airgap)**

### How to Generate the Flowchart
1. **Start Node**: Begin with "Airgap Mode Enabled?" as the root decision.
2. **Decision Nodes**: Add each decision point as an oval or diamond:
   - "Airgap Mode Enabled?" (splits to "No" and "Yes").
   - "Thin Client or Thick Client?" (two instances: one for Non-Airgap, one for Airgap).
   - "Is Bridge Cached?" (four instances: Non-Airgap Thin, Non-Airgap Thick, Airgap Thin, Airgap Thick).
   - "Bridge Download URL Provided?" (eight instances: one for each Cache state per scenario).
   - "Bridge Download Version Provided?" (sixteen instances: one for each URL state per scenario).
   - "Workflow Version Provided?" (multiple instances for Thin Client paths).
3. **Action Nodes**: Add each action as a rectangle, connecting to the appropriate decision outcome. Use colors to differentiate:
   - Blue for Thin Client Non-Airgap.
   - Green for Thin Client Airgap.
   - Red for Thick Client Non-Airgap.
   - Purple for Thick Client Airgap.
4. **Edges**: Draw arrows with labels ("No", "Yes", "+WF", "-WF") to indicate conditions.
5. **Layout**: Arrange vertically or horizontally:
   - Split "Non-Airgap" and "Airgap" as two main branches from the top.
   - Under each, split into "Thin Client" and "Thick Client".
   - Further subdivide by "Cached", "URL", "Version", and "Workflow" as needed.
