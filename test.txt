his question - 
@Srinath Akkem Thec customer has come back saying that the SARIF Report still comes out to be empty.
The scan was executed on the directory:
/opt/streamline/actions-runner/_work/dev-lfs/dev-lfs/swagger
Although the scan utilizes the NPM package manager, the Black Duck SCA Detect action is not recognizing it. On the other side, when scanned directly using the Black Duck detect, the NPM package manager is correctly identified.
The SARIF report is being generated, and an upload is initiated; however, the report remains blank without any intelligent scan data.
Additionally, multiple warnings were recorded regarding certain component-version pairs (e.g., Berkeley DB 4.8.26, Bootstrap (Twitter) 3.2.0, OpenSSL, PCRE) where the OriginId is missing. These warnings did not prevent the SARIF report from being produced but may be related to the error message: "Failed to get location details from Detect Component Locator: no available components."
Could you please review if any additional configuration or parameters are required to capture the intelligent scan data and resolve the component locator issue?
I have attached the SARIF log for your reference.

Summary

The Black Duck scan has several significant policy violations; however, the SARIF report remains empty. A review of the logs indicates that the failure to generate the SARIF report can be attributed to the following issues:

Lack of necessary detectors (notably NPM)

Network connectivity problems during component resolution

General misconfigurations or unreported errors during the SARIF generation process

Key Errors

Detector-Related Errors

ERROR: One or more required detector types were not found: NPM
INFO: No detectors found.

Network and Certificate Errors

Analysis

1. Detector Failure (Root Cause)

The SARIF report requires linking issues to file paths via detectors. The absence of the NPM detector results in:

Lack of file-based mapping for issues

The SARIF generator has no data to include in the report

This is confirmed by:

ERROR: One or more required detector types were not found: NPM

2. Network Issues

Multiple connection reset errors when attempting to connect to:

https://repo.blackduck.com

This suggests that the network may be unstable or that there are firewall/proxy issues, which could hinder the downloading of tools, updating of metadata, or resolving component links essential for the SARIF report.

3. SARIF Generator Adapters Ran but Didn't Output

The absence of file paths, success logs, or traces of SARIF creation implies:

Either there was no usable data available

Or internal errors occurred without being logged

Solution

Category



Detector

Ensure that package.json exists at the source path; remove --detect.required.detector.types=NPM if it is not needed.

Network

Ensure stable access to repo.blackduck.com and the internet; check proxy or firewall settings.
